# Hello,

<img src="/img/me.png" alt="me" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: 200px;">

Hello,
I am Mike,

Currently, I am a M.Sc. student on Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, what can I tell you about me?

Clearly, I am very interested in Machine Learning and Autonomous Cars. My thesis is in the area of Reinforcement Learning, more exactly Hierarchical RL. Going deeper into my Thesis topic, I can tell you in general that the idea is to develop a system to explore the benefits of HRL regarding Robustness, Explainability and Performance. I have worked with Machine Learning applied mainly in robotics for small autonomous vehicles and in Finance.

Regarding some old facts about me, you should know I studied Mathematics, Engineering and Economics Majors in my undergrad. I loved exploring all those different paths but sadly I didn’t graduate from all of them. Thanks to the interdisciplinary work I ended up creating different groups and finally participating as a assistant researcher in my university in Colombia. Those contacts took me to held interesting talks with the industry there regarding self-driving technologies in the market and explore different possible and potential projects merging industry and academia.

One important part of me is my curiosity, you can see all my unrelated projects. Basically, I am curious and love learning and sometimes I get carried away. I have ‘built’ hacked Nintendos, learned how to play the piano, created some web pages, hacked some cars, learn several languages, etc. etc.

I don’t know what else to tell you, so, for now, I will let some links in which you can learn more about who I am:

# Hello,

<img src="/img/me.png" alt="me" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: 200px;">

Hello! 

I am Mike,

I focus on studying how to make current Machine Learning models understand their surroundings more efficiently. I am currently working on perception through monocular cameras and self-supervised learning. Apart from that, I am also interested in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Autonomous Vehicles and lately in Brain-Computer Interfaces.

Regarding some old facts about me, you should know I studied Mathematics, Engineering and Economics Majors in my undergrad. I loved exploring all those different paths but sadly I didn’t graduate from all of them. Thanks to the interdisciplinary work I ended up creating different groups and finally participating as an assistant researcher at my university in Colombia. I had the opportunity to explore how can we apply this technologies side by side with the industry and explore different possible and potential projects merging industry and academia.

One big important part of me is curiosity. I am curious and I love learning and sometimes I get carried away. I love Mathematics, Economics, Politics, Philosophy, Engineering and Psychology.
I don’t know what else to tell you, so, for now, I will let some links in which you can learn more about who I am:

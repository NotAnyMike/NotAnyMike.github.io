# Agent-based Models applied to transportation

Taken from the paper

The purpose of this research is to identify the results of interactions between agents of the Transport Services market in order to evaluate the effect that certain policies can have in the market. In this paper we will use and Agent Based Model simulation in order to characterize the agents and its interactions, in which we include the relevants agents (drivers and costumers), behavioral rules in decision making process, and the participation rate and the competition of both firms in the market.

This document proposes a stochastic model, more specifically an model based on Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) that analyses and simulates agents behaviour. This methodology consists in assessing effects of actions and interactions of private autonomous agents over a specific system, in this case, the spacial configuration of a city (Figure 1, left). This model allows interactions with multiple heterogeneous agents and simulates simultaneous events and interactions.

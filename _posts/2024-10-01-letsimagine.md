# Let's Imagine Me

Hey everyone! I wanted to tell you about my exciting new project, "Let's Imagine Me." It's all about creating realistic photos of you for your LinkedIn, social media, and more. Imagine having stunning, lifelike images that truly represent you online. Curious? Check out [letsimagine.me](https://letsimagine.me) to see how you can enhance your digital presence.

## Fake or real?

Now, here's a fun question: can you tell if the following images are real or fake? Which one is the real one, or the fake one? Can you be 100% sure?

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/img/posts/letsimagineme/real1.jpeg" width="500px"/></td>
    <td><img src="/img/posts/letsimagineme/real2.jpeg" width="500px"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/img/posts/letsimagineme/me.jpeg" width="500px"/></td>
    <td><img src="/img/posts/letsimagineme/real3.jpg" width="500px"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Some controversy

In today's digital age, the distinction between genuine and AI-enhanced images is becoming increasingly subtle. With devices like iPhones and Pixel phones automatically retouching photos by smoothing skin and enhancing colors, the boundary between reality and artificial creation is fading. But does it really matter if an image is real or AI-generated, as long as it reflects your true self and essence? Welcome to a new era where authenticity is defined by how you feel about your images, rather than the process used to create them.

I genuinely believe that in the future, It will be the norm to have our own ai models to generate pictures your online presence. This model is the one we will use to generate our new linkedin pictue when we change jobs -- imagine a linkedin popup asking you if you want to update your profile picture with this new AI generated picture of you -- moreover imagine a dentist building the website for his business, things like "meet the team" and pictures of him and his praxis, his news letter, all AI generated.

Let's don't stop in Slack or Teams, imagine your official documents like passport or your driving license. Need a photo of you without glasses in a gray brackground?

Or let's imagine you go to your hairstylist, do you have something in mind? maybe you in pink hair or new haircut? You take your iphone out and say 'hey siri, how would I look with pink hair?'

while we wait for that future to arrive please have some fun at [letsimagine.me](https://letsimagine.me).

## Conclusion 

Let's conclude. Real or Realistic? What is more important? Clearly Realistic. Are these pictures real? Is it ok to use AI for your next passport picture?  Does it even matter? and No it does not matter.

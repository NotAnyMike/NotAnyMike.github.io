# Visual Perception for Autonomous Racing Car Competition

![eufs](/site/img/posts/EUFS/eufs.jpg)

I am part of the perception team at the EUFS team at the University of Edinburgh. The main idea is to build the perception stack in order to pass all the relevant semantic information to planning and all the other modules of the self-driving car. The Perception team works with a set of sensors, mainly Lidar and Stereo Cameras to abstract the information of the limits of the track. The problem we face is much easier than the whole problem in Fully Autonomous Driving. The competition is about the fastest car on a series of laps around a previously unseen track. The track is a closed loop limited by traffic cones at the sides, so the problem is reduced to recognizing the position on the plane of the cones. Once we abstract the position and the type of the cones it is time for the team in charge of planning.

The main architecture is based on sensor fusion coming from redundant information from Lidar and Stereo Cameras. More exactly x-y coordinates in the ground plane as well as semantic information from cameras. The system implemented so far is a simple filter to combine both sources of information, but the team is also working on applying a more complete Kalman Filter (but probably is not going to be ready for the competition).

The first image is a picture of the Race Car developed by the team, in the following year the objective is to add the necessary actuators and the hardware stack to make it fully autonomous for this task. Meanwhile, for the competition, we are provided with a self-driving race car (the image below).

Finally the the last image is the frame of an old version of our car next to a demo of the stack during this year presentation of our progress to the university and to the sponsors, you can see (more or less) the parts of the pipeline, in this case raw image, detection, lidar and path optimization.

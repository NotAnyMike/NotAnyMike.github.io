# New Project: Automate and Streamline Your Tasks

This is a very interesting new project, I am exploring all the limitations and challenges left to solve in the area of LLMs in order to develop a fully automated smart assistant to take care of 80% of the tasks of a day-to-day work, no matter in what industry it is. I am currently working on a product that automates tasks, for example, getting a quote for cathering services for an event or even help auditing a firm. The product handles connecting the right inputs in order to be able to solve tasks.

Tasks can be complex and have multiple steps or communication with different users. The first task that we integrated into our system is answering emails. We created a Chrome extension, which can be tried for free at [hashhash.fyi](https://hashhash.fyi). This innovative tool streamlines your email management and helps you stay on top of your inbox.

We are working on solving tasks that involve multiple steps that involve talking to different persons. Imagine being able to ask the smart assistant to take care of solving a task and it will manage everything automatically. It will contact whoever it needs to contact to solve the task, saving you valuable time and effort. (See image)

[stealth](ToBeDefined) is the main company building this whole system, and we are dedicated to creating a powerful tool that can revolutionize the way we handle our daily tasks. Their vision is to create an intelligent assistant that can adapt to any industry and provide unparalleled support to its users.

This new project offers a glimpse into the future of automation and smart assistants, aiming to streamline and simplify our daily work. As the technology continues to develop and evolve, the possibilities are endless. Give the email answering extension a try at [hashhash.fyi](https://hashhash.fyi) and stay updated on the progress of this exciting project at [stealth](tobedefined).

# New Project: Automate and Streamline Your Tasks

![solver](/img/posts/hashhash/917shots_so.png)

This is a very interesting new project. I am exploring the limitations and challenges left to solve in the area of LLMs in order to develop a fully automated smart assistant to take care of 80% of the tasks of day-to-day work, no matter what industry it is in. I am mainly interested in developing a project that automates tasks, for example, getting a quote for catering services for an event or even helping audit a firm. The project should handle connecting the right inputs in order to be able to solve tasks. Tasks can be complex and have multiple steps or require communication with different users.

The first task that I explored and integrated into our system was answering emails. I created a Chrome extension, which can be tried for free at [hashhash.fyi](https://hashhash.fyi). The idea was to streamline email management and help you stay on top of your inbox. The results were successful, the code should be still working but I am not longer mantaining it FYI.

Now, I am interested in working on solving tasks that involve multiple steps and necessitate talking to different persons. Imagine being able to ask the smart assistant to take care of solving a task and it will manage everything automatically. It will contact whoever it needs to in order to solve the task, saving you valuable time and effort. (See image)

I am exploring this whole new ecosystem of assistants like [Open Interpreter](https://01.openinterpreter.com/), [Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/), or [Humane Pin](https://humane.com/), and I am very interested in creating a powerful tool that can revolutionize the way we handle our daily tasks. My vision is to create an intelligent assistant that can adapt to any industry and provide unparalleled support to its users. Imagine if you can only work as the image below or a service like this ([link](https://embedelite.github.io/solver/) - I build this landing page quickly to show the concept of such an app)

This new project offers a glimpse into the future of automation and smart assistants, aiming to streamline and simplify our daily work. As the technology continues to develop and evolve, the possibilities are endless. Give the email answering extension a try at [hashhash.fyi](https://hashhash.fyi) and stay updated on the progress of this exciting project at ... there is no website, write to me instead ðŸ˜‰

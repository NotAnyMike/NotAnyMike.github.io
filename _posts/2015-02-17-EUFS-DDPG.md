#Â Using TRPO to solve Driving Task around a Track

First thing to mention is the other authors of this project, Ignat Georgiev and Johny De Bod.

The Formula Student Challenge ([link](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student)) is a competition where the idea is to build from zero a F1 race car. One of its branches is autonomous driving, where the idea is to make the car drive itself around a track made of cones. The usual solutions come form a clasical approach made by Perception, Mapping and Planning subsystems. But we decided to solve the problem using End-to-End Reinforcement Learning as a course project.

## Environment

The environment is made using ROS and Gazebo simulation, where we have the model of the team's car. The reason behind it is that we are interesting in mimiquing the same architecture used for our F1 car, therefore we have the same components in theory as the car in real life, in order to apply the code easier to the car.

The agents is equiped with different sensors, mainly one Lidar and one stereo camera, but for this task we decided to use only one monucular camera follwing the architecture of this paper ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00412)). The tracks are made of yellow and blue traffic cones for each side of the track.

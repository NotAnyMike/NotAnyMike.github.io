# CarRacing-v1 (Improving OpenAI gym)

For this project I improved the environment CarRacing-v0 from [*OpenAI Gym*](https://gym.openai.com/){:target="_blank"}. This in order to make this environment more complex and interesting.

This first version is an improvement over OpenAI gym Car-Racing-v0, which is focus towards making `Car-Racing` env solvable, it is also intended to make the environment complex enough to make it ideal to try new and more complex tasks.
